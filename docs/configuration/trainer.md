configure the training process, like the number of epochs or the learning rate.

# Configuring training length

The length of the training process is configured by:

* `epochs` (default: 100): One epoch is one pass through the entire dataset. By
    default, `epochs` is 100 which means that the training process will run for
    a maximum of 100 epochs before terminating.
* `train_steps` (default: `None`): The maximum number of steps to train for,
    using one mini-batch per step. By default this is unset, and `epochs` will
    be used to determine training length.

!!! tip

    In general, it's a good idea to set up a long training runway, relying on
    early stopping criteria (`early_stop`) to stop training when there
    hasn't been any improvement for a long time.

# Configuring checkpoint and evaluation frequency

Evaluation is run every time the model is checkpointed.

By default, checkpoint-evaluation will occur once every epoch.

The frequency of checkpoint-evaluation can be configured using:

* `steps_per_checkpoint` (default: 0): every `n` training steps
* `checkpoints_per_epoch` (default: 0): `n` times per epoch

!!! note

    It is invalid to specify both non-zero `steps_per_checkpoint` and non-zero
    `checkpoints_per_epoch`.

!!! tip

    Running evaluation once per epoch is an appropriate fit for tabular
    datasets, which are small, fit in memory, and train quickly.

    However, this can be a poor fit for unstructured datasets, which tend to be
    much larger, and train more slowly due to larger models.

    We recommend configuring evaluation such that new evaluation results are
    available several times an hour. In general, it is not necessary for models
    to train over the entirety of a dataset, nor evaluate over the entirety of a
    test set, to produce useful monitoring metrics and signals to indicate model
    performance.

!!! tip

    Running evaluation too frequently can be wasteful while running evaluation
    not frequently enough can be uninformative. In large-scale training runs,
    it's common for evaluation to be configured to run on a sub-epoch time
    scale, or every few thousand steps.

# Increasing throughput

Consider setting `evaluate_training_set=False`, which skips evaluation on the
training set.

!!! note

    Sometimes it can be useful to monitor evaluation metrics on the training
    set, as a secondary validation set. However, running evaluation on the full
    training set, when your training set is large, can be a huge computational
    cost. Turning off training set evaluation will lead to significant gains in
    training throughput and efficiency.

Users training on GPUs can often increase training throughput by increasing
the `batch_size` so that more examples are computed every training step. Set
`batch_size` to `auto` to use the largest batch size that can fit in memory.

# Trainer parameters

* `epochs` (default `100`): number of epochs the training process will run for.
* `train_steps` (default `None`): Maximum number of training steps the training process will run for. If unset, then `epochs` is used to determine training length.
* `early_stop` (default `5`): Number of consecutive rounds of evaluation without any improvement on the `validation_metric` that triggers training to stop. Can be set to -1, which disables early stopping entirely.
* `batch_size` (default `128`): size of the batch used for training the model.
* `eval_batch_size` (default `null`): size of the batch used for evaluating the model. If it is `0`, the same value of `batch_size` is used. This is useful to speedup evaluation with a much bigger batch size than training, if enough memory is available.
* `evaluate_training_set`: Whether to include the entire training set during evaluation (default: True).
* `checkpoints_per_epoch`: Number of checkpoints per epoch. For example, 2 -> checkpoints are written every half of an epoch. Note that it is invalid to specify both non-zero `steps_per_checkpoint` and non-zero `checkpoints_per_epoch` (default: 0).
* `steps_per_checkpoint`: How often the model is checkpointed. Also dictates maximum evaluation frequency. If 0 the model is checkpointed after every epoch. (default: 0).
* `regularization_lambda` (default `0`): the lambda parameter used for adding regularization loss to the overall loss.
* `regularization_type` (default `l2`): the type of regularization.
* `learning_rate` (default `0.001`): the learning rate to use.
* `reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau` (default `0`): if theres a validation set, how many times to reduce the learning rate when a plateau of validation measure is reached.
* `reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau_patience` (default `5`): if theres a validation set, number of epochs of patience without an improvement on the validation measure before reducing the learning rate.
* `reduce_learning_rate_on_plateau_rate` (default `0.5`): if theres a validation set, the reduction rate of the learning rate.
* `increase_batch_size_on_plateau` (default `0`): if theres a validation set, how many times to increase the batch size when a plateau of validation measure is reached.
* `increase_batch_size_on_plateau_patience` (default `5`): if theres a validation set, number of epochs of patience without an improvement on the validation measure before increasing the learning rate.
* `increase_batch_size_on_plateau_rate` (default `2`): if theres a validation set, the increase rate of the batch size.
* `increase_batch_size_on_plateau_max` (default `512`): if theres a validation set, the maximum value of batch size.
* `decay` (default `false`): if to use exponential decay of the learning rate or not.
* `decay_rate` (default `0.96`): the rate of the exponential learning rate decay.
* `decay_steps` (default `10000`): the number of steps of the exponential learning rate decay.
* `staircase` (default `false`): decays the learning rate at discrete intervals.
* `validation_field` (default `combined`): when there is more than one output feature, which one to use for computing if there was an improvement on validation. The measure to use to determine if there was an improvement can be set with the `validation_measure` parameter. Different data types have different metrics, refer to the datatype-specific section for more details. `combined` indicates the use the combination of all features. For instance the combination of `combined` and `loss` as measure uses a decrease in the combined loss of all output features to check for improvement on validation, while `combined` and `accuracy` considers on how many examples the predictions for all output features were correct (but consider that for some features, for instance `numeric` there is no accuracy measure, so you should use `accuracy` only if all your output features have an accuracy measure).
* `validation_metric` (default `loss`): the metric to use to determine if there was an improvement. The metric is considered for the output feature specified in `validation_field`. Different data types have different available metrics, refer to the datatype-specific section for more details.
* `bucketing_field` (default `null`): when not `null`, when creating batches, instead of shuffling randomly, the length along the last dimension of the matrix of the specified input feature is used for bucketing examples and then randomly shuffled examples from the same bin are sampled. Padding is trimmed to the longest example in the batch. The specified feature should be either a `sequence` or `text` feature and the encoder encoding it has to be `rnn`. When used, bucketing improves speed of `rnn` encoding up to 1.5x, depending on the length distribution of the inputs.
* `learning_rate_warmup_epochs` (default `1`): Its the number or training epochs where learning rate warmup will be used. It is calculated as described in [Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677). In the paper the authors suggest `6` epochs of warmup, that parameter is suggested for large datasets and big batches.
* `optimizer` (default `{type: adam, beta1: 0.9, beta2: 0.999, epsilon: 1e-08}`): which optimizer to use with the relative parameters. The available optimizers are: `sgd` (or `stochastic_gradient_descent`, `gd`, `gradient_descent`, they are all the same), `adam`, `adadelta`, `adagrad`, `adamax`, `ftrl`, `nadam`, `rmsprop`. Check [PyTorch optimizer documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) for a full list of parameters for each optimizer. The optimizer definition can also specify gradient clipping using `clipglobalnorm`, `clipnorm`, and `clipvalue`.

# Optimizer parameters

The available optimizers wrap the ones available in PyTorch.
For details about the parameters that can be used to configure different optimizers, please refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).

The `learning_rate` parameter the optimizer will use come from the `trainer` section.
