This section contains several examples of how to build models with Ludwig for a variety of tasks.
For each task we show an example dataset and a sample model definition that can be used to train a model from that data.

Write-ups in the **Tutorials** section show both Ludwig's command line interface and Python API.  For these tutorials, there are ready-to-run notebooks that work in [Google's Colab Service](https://colab.research.google.com/).  The notebooks provide the user a starting point for learning about Ludwig capabilities.

The **Example Use Cases** section illustrate how Ludwig can be applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, such as, natural language understanding, timeseries forcasting, multi-label classification to name just a few.

In addition to the examples here, on the Ludwig medium publication you can find a three part tutorial on Sentiment Analysis with Ludwig:
