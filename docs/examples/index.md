💡 Hands-on examples are the best way to learn about a new framework.

Here, you'll find several examples of how to build models with Ludwig for a variety of tasks with LLMs, neural networks, and tree-based models. We provide sample datasets, commands, scripts, and colab notebooks. Please [reach out](https://join.slack.com/t/ludwig-ai/shared_invite/zt-mrxo87w6-DlX5~73T2B4v_g6jj0pJcQ) if you have any questions!

💬 The **LLMs** section gives a broad overview of the full breadth of Ludwig's LLM capabilities like [zero-shot batch inference]() and [fine-tuning Llama-2-7b]().

🎯 The **Supervised ML** section has in-depth tutorials for how to use Ludwig's command line interface and Python API for machine learning in a supervised setting. Check out [Image Classification on MNIST](http://127.0.0.1:8000/examples/mnist/).

🏛️ The **Use Cases** section illustrates how Ludwig can be applied to a variety of machine learning tasks, such as, natural language understanding, timeseries forcasting, multi-label classification to name just a few. Read about Ludwig models for [Sentiment Analysis]().
