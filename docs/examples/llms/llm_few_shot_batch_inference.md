This is a simple example of how to load an LLM from huggingface to perform text
classification for a list of review/label pairs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

This example uses the `facebook/opt-350m` model as the base LLM model.

Semantically relevant examples are injected into the prompt as additional context, as specified by the `prompt` section of the Ludwig config.

```yaml
prompt:
    task: "Classify the sample input as either negative, neutral, or positive."
    retrieval:
        type: semantic
        k: 3
        model_name: paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2
```

The LLM generates textual output and the results are decoded into labels using
regex-based post-processing, specified in the Ludwig configuration.

```yaml
output_features:
-
    name: label
    type: category
    preprocessing:
        fallback_label: "neutral"
    decoder:
        type: category_extractor
        match:
            "negative":
                type: contains
                value: "positive"
            "neural":
                type: contains
                value: "neutral"
            "positive":
                type: contains
                value: "positive"
```
