This is a simple example of how to load an LLM from huggingface to perform text
classification for a list of review/label pairs in a zero-shot manner.

This example uses the `facebook/opt-350m` model as the base LLM model.

The LLM generates textual output and the results are decoded into labels using
regex-based post-processing, specified in the Ludwig configuration.
