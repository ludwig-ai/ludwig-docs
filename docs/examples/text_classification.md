This example shows how to build a text classifier with Ludwig.

These interactive notebooks follow the steps of this example:

We'll be using AG's news topic classification dataset, a common benchmark dataset for text classification. This dataset
is a subset of the full AG news dataset, constructed by choosing the four largest classes from the original corpus. Each
class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 with
7,600 total testing samples. The original split does not include a validation set, so we've labeled the first 5% of each
training set class as the validation set.

This dataset contains four columns:

| column      | description                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| class_index | An integer from 1 to 4: "world", "sports", "business", "sci_tech" respectively |
| class       | A string, one of "world", "sports", "business", "sci_tech"                     |
| title       | Title of the news article                                                      |
| description | Description of the news article                                                |

Ludwig also provides several other text classification benchmark datasets which can be used, including:

- [Amazon Reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html)
- [BBC News](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/overview)
- [IMDB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
- [Yelp Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)

## Download Dataset

=== "cli"

    Downloads the dataset and write to `agnews.csv` in the current directory.

    ```shell
    ludwig datasets download agnews
    ```

=== "python"

    Downloads the AG news dataset into a pandas dataframe.

    ```python
    from ludwig.datasets import agnews

    # Loads the dataset as a pandas.DataFrame
    train_df, test_df, _ = agnews.load()
    ```

The dataset contains the above four columns plus an additional `split` column which is one of 0: train, 1: test,
2: validation.

Sample (description text omitted for space):

```
class_index,title,description,split,class
3,Carlyle Looks Toward Commercial Aerospace (Reuters),...,0,business
3,Oil and Economy Cloud Stocks' Outlook (Reuters),...,0,business
3,Iraq Halts Oil Exports from Main Southern Pipeline (Reuters),...,0,business
```

## Train

### Define ludwig config

The Ludwig config declares the machine learning task. It tells Ludwig what to predict, what columns to use as input, and
optionally specifies the model type and hyperparameters.

Here, for simplicity, we'll try to predict **class** from **title**.

=== "cli"

    With `config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    input_features:
        -
            name: title
            type: text
            encoder: 
                type: parallel_cnn
    output_features:
        -
            name: class
            type: category
    trainer:
        epochs: 3
    ```

=== "python"

    With config defined in a python dict:

    ```python
    config = {
      "input_features": [
        {
          "name": "title",            # The name of the input column
          "type": "text",             # Data type of the input column
          "encoder": {
                "type": "parallel_cnn"
           }                          # The model architecture we should use for encoding this column
        }
      ],
      "output_features": [
        {
          "name": "class",
          "type": "category",
        }
      ],
      "trainer": {
        "epochs": 3,  # We'll train for three epochs. Training longer might give
                      # better performance.
      }
    }
    ```

### Create and train a model

=== "cli"

    ```shell
    ludwig train --dataset agnews.csv -c config.yaml
    ```

=== "python"

    ```python
    # Constructs Ludwig model from config dictionary
    model = LudwigModel(config, logging_level=logging.INFO)

    # Trains the model. This cell might take a few minutes.
    train_stats, preprocessed_data, output_directory = model.train(dataset=train_df)
    ```

## Evaluate

Generates predictions and performance statistics for the test set.

=== "cli"

    ```shell
    ludwig evaluate \
        --model_path results/experiment_run/model \
        --dataset agnews.csv \
        --split test \
        --output_directory test_results
    ```

=== "python"

    ```python
    # Generates predictions and performance statistics for the test set.
    test_stats, predictions, output_directory = model.evaluate(
      test_df,
      collect_predictions=True,
      collect_overall_stats=True
    )
    ```

## Visualize Metrics

Visualizes confusion matrix, which gives an overview of classifier performance for each class.

=== "cli"

    ```shell
    ludwig visualize \
        --visualization confusion_matrix \
        --ground_truth_metadata results/experiment_run/model/training_set_metadata.json \
        --test_statistics test_results/test_statistics.json \
        --output_directory visualizations \
        --file_format png
    ```

=== "python"

    ```python
    from ludwig.visualize import confusion_matrix

    confusion_matrix(
      [test_stats],
      model.training_set_metadata,
      'class',
      top_n_classes=[5],
      model_names=[''],
      normalize=True,
    )
    ```

| Confusion Matrix                                                     | Class Entropy                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Confusion Matrix](text_classification/images/confusion_matrix.png) | ![Confusion Matrix Entropy](text_classification/images/confusion_matrix_entropy.png) |

Visualizes learning curves, which show how performance metrics changed over time during training.

=== "cli"

    ```shell
    ludwig visualize \
        --visualization learning_curves \
        --ground_truth_metadata results/experiment_run/model/training_set_metadata.json \
        --training_statistics results/experiment_run/training_statistics.json \
        --file_format png \
        --output_directory visualizations
    ```

=== "python"

    ```python
    # Visualizes learning curves, which show how performance metrics changed over
    # time during training.
    from ludwig.visualize import learning_curves

    learning_curves(train_stats, output_feature_name='class')
    ```

| Losses                                                                | Metrics                                                    |

## Make Predictions on New Data

Lastly we'll show how to generate predictions for new data.

The following are some recent news headlines. Feel free to edit or add your own strings to text_to_predict to see how
the newly trained model classifies them.

=== "cli"

    With `text_to_predict.csv`:

    ```
    title
    Google may spur cloud cybersecurity M&A with $5.4B Mandiant buy
    Europe struggles to meet mounting needs of Ukraine's fleeing millions
    How the pandemic housing market spurred buyer's remorse across America
    ```

    ```shell
    ludwig predict \
        --model_path results/experiment_run/model \
        --dataset text_to_predict.csv \
        --output_directory predictions
    ```

=== "python"

    ```python
    text_to_predict = pd.DataFrame({
      "title": [
        "Google may spur cloud cybersecurity M&A with $5.4B Mandiant buy",
        "Europe struggles to meet mounting needs of Ukraine's fleeing millions",
        "How the pandemic housing market spurred buyer's remorse across America",
      ]
    })

    predictions, output_directory = model.predict(text_to_predict)
    ```

This command will write predictions to `output_directory`. Predictions outputs are written in multiple formats including
csv and parquet. For instance, `predictions/predictions.parquet` contains the predicted classes for each example as well
as the psuedo-probabilities for each class:

| class_predictions | class_probabilities          | class_probability | class_probabilities_&lt;UNK&gt; | class_probabilities_sci_tech | class_probabilities_sports | class_probabilities_world | class_probabilities_business |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| sci_tech          | [1.9864278277825775e-10, ... | 0.954650          | 1.986428e-10                    | 0.954650                     | 0.000033                   | 0.002563                  | 0.042754                     |
