Combiners are part of the model that take all the outputs of the different input features and combine them in a single representation that is passed to the outputs.
You can specify which one to use in the `combiner` section of the configuration.
Different combiners implement different combination logic, but the default one `concat` just concatenates all outputs of input feature encoders and optionally passes the concatenation through fully connected layers, with the output of the last layer being forwarded to the outputs decoders.

```
+-----------+
|Input      |
|Feature 1  +-+
+-----------+ |            +---------+
+-----------+ | +------+   |Fully    |
|...        +--->Concat+--->Connected+->
+-----------+ | +------+   |Layers   |
+-----------+ |            +---------+
|Input      +-+
|Feature N  |
+-----------+
```

For the sake of simplicity you can imagine the both inputs and outputs are vectors in most of the cases, but there are `reduce_input` and `reduce_output` parameters to specify to change the default behavior.
