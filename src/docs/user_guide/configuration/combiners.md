Combiners are the part of the model that take the outputs of the encoders of all input features and combine them before providing the combined representation to the different output decoders.
If you don't specify a combiner, the `concat` combiner will be used.

## Concat Combiner

The `concat` combiner assumes all outputs from encoders are tensors of size `b x h` where `b` is the batch size and `h` is the hidden dimension, which can be different for each input.
If inputs are tensors with different shapes, set the `flatten_inputs` parameter to `true`.
It concatenates along the `h` dimension, and then (optionally) passes the concatenated tensor through a stack of fully connected layers.
It returns the final `b x h'` tensor where `h'` is the size of the last fully connected layer or the sum of the sizes of the `h` of all inputs in the case there are no fully connected layers.
If there's only one input feature and no fully connected layers are specified, the output of the input feature is just passed through as output.

```

|Input      |
|Feature 1  +-+
+-----------+ |            +---------+
+-----------+ | +------+   |Fully    |
|...        +--->Concat+--->Connected+->
+-----------+ | +------+   |Layers   |
+-----------+ |            +---------+
|Input      +-+
|Feature N  |
+-----------+
```

These are the available parameters of a `concat` combiner:

- `fc_layers` (default `null`): it is a list of dictionaries containing the parameters of all the fully connected layers. The length of the list determines the number of stacked fully connected layers and the content of each dictionary determines the parameters for a specific layer. The available parameters for each layer are: `fc_size`, `norm`, `activation`, `dropout`, `initializer` and `regularize`. If any of those values is missing from the dictionary, the default one specified as a parameter of the decoder will be used instead.
- `num_fc_layers` (default 0): this is the number of stacked fully connected layers that the input to the feature passes through. Their output is projected in the feature's output space.
- `fc_size` (default `256`): if a `fc_size` is not already specified in `fc_layers` this is the default `fc_size` that will be used for each layer. It indicates the size of the output of a fully connected layer.
- `use_bias` (default `true`): boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
- `weights_initializer` (default `'glorot_uniform'`): initializer for the weights matrix. Options are: `constant`, `identity`, `zeros`, `ones`, `orthogonal`, `normal`, `uniform`, `truncated_normal`, `variance_scaling`, `glorot_normal`, `glorot_uniform`, `xavier_normal`, `xavier_uniform`, `he_normal`, `he_uniform`, `lecun_normal`, `lecun_uniform`. Alternatively it is possible to specify a dictionary with a key `type` that identifies the type of initializer and other keys for its parameters, e.g. `{type: normal, mean: 0, stddev: 0}`. To know the parameters of each initializer, please refer to [TensorFlow's documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers).
- `bias_initializer` (default `'zeros'`):  initializer for the bias vector. Options are: `constant`, `identity`, `zeros`, `ones`, `orthogonal`, `normal`, `uniform`, `truncated_normal`, `variance_scaling`, `glorot_normal`, `glorot_uniform`, `xavier_normal`, `xavier_uniform`, `he_normal`, `he_uniform`, `lecun_normal`, `lecun_uniform`. Alternatively it is possible to specify a dictionary with a key `type` that identifies the type of initializer and other keys for its parameters, e.g. `{type: normal, mean: 0, stddev: 0}`. To know the parameters of each initializer, please refer to [TensorFlow's documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers).
- `weights_regularizer` (default `null`): regularizer function applied to the weights matrix.  Valid values are `l1`, `l2` or `l1_l2`.
- `bias_regularizer` (default `null`): regularizer function applied to the bias vector.  Valid values are `l1`, `l2` or `l1_l2`.
- `activity_regularizer` (default `null`): regurlizer function applied to the output of the layer.  Valid values are `l1`, `l2` or `l1_l2`.
- `norm` (default `null`): if a `norm` is not already specified in `fc_layers` this is the default `norm` that will be used for each layer. It indicates the norm of the output and it can be `null`, `batch` or `layer`.
- `norm_params` (default `null`): parameters used if `norm` is either `batch` or `layer`.  For information on parameters used with `batch` see [Tensorflow's documentation on batch normalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) or for `layer` see [Tensorflow's documentation on layer normalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LayerNormalization).
- `activation` (default `relu`): if an `activation` is not already specified in `fc_layers` this is the default `activation` that will be used for each layer. It indicates the activation function applied to the output.
- `dropout` (default `0`): dropout rate.
- `flatten_inputs` (default `false`): if `true` flatten the tensors from all the input features into a vector.
- `residual` (default `false`): if `true` adds a residual connection to each fully connected layer block. It is required that all fully connected layers have the same size for this parameter to work correctly.

Example configuration of a `concat` combiner:

```yaml
type: concat
fc_layers: null
num_fc_layers: 0
fc_size: 256
use_bias: true
weights_initializer: 'glorot_uniform'
bias_initializer: 'zeros'
weights_regularizer: null
bias_regularizer: null
activity_regularizer: null
norm: null
norm_params: null
activation: relu
dropout: 0
flatten_inputs: false
residual: false
```

## Sequence Concat Combiner

The `sequence?concat` combiner assumes at least one output from encoders is a tensors of size `b x s x h` where `b` is the batch size, `s` is the length of the sequence and `h` is the hidden dimension.
The sequence / text / sequential input can be specified with the `main_sequence_feature` parameter that should have the name of the sequential feature as value.
If no `main_sequence_feature` is specified, the combiner will look through all the features in the order they are defined in the configuration and will look for a feature with a rank 3 tensor output (sequence, text or time series).
If it cannot find one it will raise an exception, otherwise the output of that feature will be used for concatenating the other features along the sequence `s` dimension.

If there are other input features with a rank 3 output tensor, the combiner will concatenate them alongside the `s` dimension, which means that all of them must have identical `s` dimension, otherwise an error will be thrown.
Specifically, as the placeholders of the sequential features are of dimension `[None, None]` in order to make the `BucketedBatcher` trim longer sequences to their actual length, the check if the sequences are of the same length cannot be performed at model building time, and a dimension mismatch error will be returned during training when a datapoint with two sequential features of different lengths are provided.

Other features that have a `b x h` rank 2 tensor output will be replicated `s` times and concatenated to the `s` dimension.
The final output is a `b x s x h'` tensor where `h'` is the size of the concatenation of the `h` dimensions of all input features.

```

```

These are the available parameters of a `sequence_concat` combiner:

- `main_sequence_feature` (default `null`): name of the sequence / text/ time series feature to concatenate the outputs of the other features to. If no `main_sequence_feature` is specified, the combiner will look through all the features in the order they are defined in the configuration and will look for a feature with a rank 3 tensor output (sequence, text or time series). If it cannot find one it will raise an exception, otherwise the output of that feature will be used for concatenating the other features along the sequence `s` dimension. If there are other input features with a rank 3 output tensor, the combiner will concatenate them alongside the `s` dimension, which means that all of them must have identical `s` dimension, otherwise an error will be thrown.
- `reduce_output` (default `null`): describes the strategy to use to aggregate the embeddings of the items of the set. Possible values are `null`, `sum`, `mean` and `sqrt` (the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the weights).

Example configuration of a `sequence_concat` combiner:

```yaml
type: sequence_concat
main_sequence_feature: null
reduce_output: null
```

## Sequence Combiner

The `sequence` combiner stacks a sequence concat combiner with a sequence encoder one on top of each other.
All the considerations about inputs tensor ranks describer for the [sequence concat combiner](#sequence-concat-combiner) apply also in this case, but the main difference is that this combiner uses the `b x s x h'` output of the sequence concat combiner, where `b` is the batch size, `s` is the sequence length and `h'` is the sum of the hidden dimensions of all input features, as input for any of the sequence encoders described in the [sequence features encoders section](#sequence-inpit-features-and-encoders).
Refer to that section for more detailed information about the sequence encoders and their parameters.
Also all the considerations on the shape of the outputs done for the sequence encoders apply in this case too.

## TabNet Combiner

The `tabnet` combiner implements the [TabNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442) model, which uses attention and sparsity to achieve high performnce on tabular data.
It assumes all outputs from encoders are tensors of size `b x h` where `b` is the batch size and `h` is the hidden dimension, which can be different for each input.
If the input tensors have a different shape, it automatically flattens them.
It returns the final `b x h'` tensor where `h'` is the user-specified output size.

- `bn_momentum` (default `0.7`): momentum of the batch norm. `m_B` in the paper.
- `bn_virtual_bs` (default `null`): size of the virtual batch size used by ghost batch norm. If `null`, regular batch norm is used instead. `B_v` from the paper.

## Transformer Combiner

The `transformer` combiner combines imput features using a stack of Transformer blocks (from [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).
It assumes all outputs from encoders are tensors of size `b x h` where `b` is the batch size and `h` is the hidden dimension, which can be different for each input.
If the input tensors have a different shape, it automatically flattens them.
It then projects each input tensor to the same hidden / embedding size and encodes them wit ha stack of Tranformer layers.
Finally it applies an reduction to the outputs of the Transformer stack and applies optional fully connected layers. 
It returns the final `b x h'` tensor where `h'` is the size of the last fully connected layer or the hidden / embedding size , or it returns `b x n x h'` where `n` is the number of input features and `h'` is the hidden / embedding size if there's no reduction applied.

## Comparator Combiner

The `comparator` combiner compares the hidden representation of two entities definef by lists of features.
It assumes all outputs from encoders are tensors of size `b x h` where `b` is the batch size and `h` is the hidden dimension, which can be different for each input.
If the input tensors have a different shape, it automatically flattens them.
It then concatenates the representations of each entity end projects them into the same size.
Finally it compares the two entity representations by dot product, element-wise multiplication, absolute difference and bilinear product. 
It returns the final `b x h'` tensor where `h'` is the size of the concatenation of the four comparisons.
